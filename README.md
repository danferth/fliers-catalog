The sales team and customer service has issues beyond the weird messed up way the company creates and used part numbers *(revision notation is in the part number so every revision creates a new part!)*.  This mini-site is to be stuck in a folder so sales and customer service has a go to place to see the most up to date info on fliers and catalogs.
